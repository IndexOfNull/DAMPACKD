Fixes:
- Fix bread recipe [done]
- Fix transfer pipe recipe [done]
- Wonder why tf chancecubes ignores Item_Of_Destiny being false [Needs version revert, config is broken on latest it seems]
- Blacklist dread_scuttler on Ice and Fire (enderio) [done]

Balancing:
- look into soul generator viability (making them 66% efficient) [in progress]
- make ice and fire dragons even rarer
- adjust dimension builder recipe to require less awakened draconium (10 -> 8 or 4 blocks, shoot for only 1-2 dragon defeats) [done]
- maybe tweak draconic oregen (perhaps less common in end, spawn more primarly through galacticraft?)
- maybe make vanilla ender chests harder to make

Additions/Removals (+ = addition, - = removal, # = up for consideration):
+ [probably] Its the little things (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/its-the-little-things/files)
- [probably] remove KleeSlabs (not really worth it given its 1 main feature)
# [definitely] check out recurrent complex (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/recurrent-complex)
# [probably] check out rats mod
# [unlikely] consider mystical agriculture + maybe aggraditions
# [probably] consider swapping thaumcraft for blood magic
# [maybe] consider adding dynamic trees
- [probably] remove doggytalents
+/- consider swapping Aether II for the first Aether mod
- [maybe] consider removing powerconverters (flux networks could achieve this)
- [probably] consider removing GLASS
+ [unlikely] add more player models
