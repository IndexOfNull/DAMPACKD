Fixes:
- Migrate to chancecube profiles [done, needs testing]

- Fix bread recipe [done]
- Fix transfer pipe recipe [done]
- Blacklist dread_scuttler on Ice and Fire (enderio) [done]

Balancing:
- make ice and fire dragons even rarer
- maybe make vanilla ender chests harder to make
- maybe tweak draconic oregen (perhaps less common in end, spawn more primarly through galacticraft?)
- look into soul generator viability (making them 66% efficient) [done, needs testing]

- adjust dimension builder recipe to require less awakened draconium (10 -> 8 or 4 blocks, shoot for only 1-2 dragon defeats) [done]
