# DAMPACK'D 1.2 to-do list

## Fixes:
- [x] Migrate to chancecube profiles ***(chancecubes reports that rewards are disabled)***
- [x] ~~Fix bread recipe~~
- [x] ~~Fix transfer pipe recipe~~
- [x] ~~Blacklist dread_scuttler on Ice and Fire (enderio)~~

## Balancing:
- [x] kneecap ice and fire again ***(needs testing, make sure that no dragons spawn within close to each other)***
- [x] ~~look into soul generator viability (making them 66% efficient) ***(done, needs testing)***~~
- [x] ~~maybe all enderchests/pouches harder to make~~
- [x] ~~make compact machines harder to make~~
- [x] ~~adjust dimension builder recipe to require less awakened draconium (10 -> 8 or 4 blocks, shoot for only 1-2 dragon defeats)~~
- [-] ~~maybe tweak draconic oregen (perhaps less common in end, spawn more primarly through galacticraft?)~~ ***(doesn't seem easily possible)***

## Features:
+ [x] [probably] see about making custom structures with recurrent complex. (do this after RC1)
+ [x] new main menu backgrounds (do after everything else is done)
+ [x] ~~maybe move this TODO into a markdown format~~

# Mod Changes

### Additions
+ [x] More splash texts! ***(done adding more, for now)***
+ [x] [highly likely] add [recurrent complex](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/recurrent-complex)
+ [-] ~~check out rats mod~~ ***(played it on another pack, don't want to deal with it right now)***
+ [-] [maybe] consider adding dynamic trees ***(going to pass for now, may consider later)***
+ [x] ~~[unlikely] consider mystical agriculture + maybe aggraditions~~ (added)
    + [x] Make supremium stuff harder to get (wound up removing all tools and fun items; crops only!)
+ [x] ~~[Its the little things](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/its-the-little-things/files)~~

### Removals
- [x] ~~remove KleeSlabs~~
- [x] ~~remove powerconverters~~
- [x] ~~remove GLASS~~

### Other
+ [x] [probably] consider swapping Aether II for the first Aether mod (want to double checker Aether 2 first)
    + [x] check out Aether 1 expansion mods? ***(went with Lost Content only)***
+ [-] ~~[probably] consider swapping thaumcraft for blood magic (preferably do this last, BM may require special balancing)~~ ***(the blood magic guide is 144 pages long, maybe check it out in 1.3 instead?)***
+ [x] [definitely] make scripts to auto-assemble release profiles (client + server, with specific options for both)
+ [x] make sure Galacticraft is updated (this is a must to comply with their terms of use)
