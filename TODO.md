# DAMPACK'D 1.2 to-do list

## Fixes:
- [ ] Migrate to chancecube profiles (done, needs testing)
- [x] ~~Fix bread recipe~~
- [x] ~~Fix transfer pipe recipe~~
- [x] ~~Blacklist dread_scuttler on Ice and Fire (enderio)~~

## Balancing:
- [ ] make ice and fire dragons even rarer
- [ ] maybe make vanilla ender chests harder to make
- [ ] maybe tweak draconic oregen (perhaps less common in end, spawn more primarly through galacticraft?)
- [ ] look into soul generator viability (making them 66% efficient) [done, needs testing]
- [ ] make compact machines harder to make
- [x] ~~adjust dimension builder recipe to require less awakened draconium (10 -> 8 or 4 blocks, shoot for only 1-2 dragon defeats)~~

## Features:
+ [ ] [probably] see about making custom structures with recurrent complex.
+ [ ] maybe move this TODO into a markdown format
