# DAMPACK'D 1.2 to-do list

## Fixes:
- [ ] Migrate to chancecube profiles ***(done, needs testing)***
- [x] ~~Fix bread recipe~~
- [x] ~~Fix transfer pipe recipe~~
- [x] ~~Blacklist dread_scuttler on Ice and Fire (enderio)~~

## Balancing:
- [ ] kneecap ice and fire again ***(needs testing, make sure that no dragons spawn within 2000 blocks of each other)***
- [x] ~~look into soul generator viability (making them 66% efficient) ***(done, needs testing)***~~
- [x] ~~maybe all enderchests/pouches harder to make~~
- [x] ~~make compact machines harder to make~~
- [x] ~~adjust dimension builder recipe to require less awakened draconium (10 -> 8 or 4 blocks, shoot for only 1-2 dragon defeats)~~
- [ ] ~~maybe tweak draconic oregen (perhaps less common in end, spawn more primarly through galacticraft?)~~ ***(doesn't seem easily possible)***

## Features:
+ [ ] [probably] see about making custom structures with recurrent complex. (do this after RC1)
+ [x] ~~maybe move this TODO into a markdown format~~

# Mod Changes

### Other
+ [ ] [probably] consider swapping Aether II for the first Aether mod (want to double checker Aether 2 first)
    + [ ] check out Aether 1 expansion mods?
